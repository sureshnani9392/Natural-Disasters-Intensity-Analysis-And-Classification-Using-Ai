                <p>A natural disaster is the highly harmful impact on a society or community following a natural hazard event. 
                    Some examples of natural hazard events include: flooding, drought, earthquake, tropical cyclone, lightning, tsunami, 
                    volcanic activity, wildfire. A natural disaster can cause loss of life or damage property, and typically leaves economic damage
                    in its wake. The severity of the damage depends on the affected population's resilience and on the infrastructure available. 
                    Scholars have been saying that the term natural disaster is unsuitable and should be abandoned. Instead, the simpler term disaster
                    could be used, while also specifying the category (or type) of hazard. A disaster is a result of a natural or human-made
                    hazard impacting a vulnerable community. It is the combination of the hazard along with exposure of a vulnerable society that
                    results in a disaster. In modern times, the divide between natural, human-made and human-accelerated disasters is quite difficult to draw.
                    Human choices and activities like architecture, fire,resource management and climate change potentially play a role in causing 
                    natural disasters. In fact, the term natural disaster has been called a misnomer already in 1976.</p>
